## Overview

ElenixOS is an open-source smartwatch operating system that builds its graphical interface based on LVGL, with watch faces and applications running on a unified script engine powered by JerryScript.

The system adopts a script-based application runtime model, where UI structure and interaction logic are described in JavaScript, while underlying native code handles graphics rendering, event scheduling, and hardware resource management. This enables a flexible and efficient application development experience on resource-constrained embedded platforms.

ElenixOS emphasizes portability and extensibility in its design, providing clear abstraction layers and unified interfaces for easy porting to different MCUs and hardware platforms. Meanwhile, watch faces and applications share the same runtime environment and API system, reducing system complexity and improving overall consistency.

In terms of user experience, ElenixOS's overall UI and interaction style references Apple Watch, focusing on animation smoothness, gesture operations, and interface hierarchy. Combined with LVGL's animation system and event mechanism, it aims to provide a visual and interactive experience close to native smartwatches on embedded devices.

ElenixOS is suitable for both personal projects and learning research, as well as serving as a customizable smart wearable system foundation framework, providing developers with a complete solution from the bottom layer to the application layer.
